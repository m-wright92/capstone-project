# techNet

By Michael Wright

This is a mock social media site for tech enthusiasts. It is a full-stack application built entirely through Ruby/Rails. It is a work in progress, and I will be adding more features in the near future.

## Link to research repo
https://github.com/m-wright92/capstone_research

## Technologies Used
* Ruby 2.6.10
* Rails 5.2.8
* PostgreSQL
* Rspec
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* Bootstrap


## Description
This is a social media site for tech enthusiasts. Currently users can create an account, log in, create posts, and add each other as friends. When a request is sent, the other user will have the option to accept or decline the request. More features will be added in the near future. 

## Setup
* Clone this repository
* Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal
* Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies
* Run `rails db:schema:load` to create the database
* Run `rails db:seed` to seed the database(optional)
* Run `rails s` to start the server
* Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser

## Known Bugs
* You can see posts from users who are not your friends
* You can't delete/edit posts


## Stretch Goals
* Add ability to post images/code snippets
* Add a search bar to find users
* Add a comment feature for posts
* Add a reaction feature for posts/comments
* Add a profile picture feature
* Add a chat feature
* Add a bio feature
* Add ability to edit/delete posts
* Add ability to edit/delete comments

Name of Student: Mike Wright

Name of Project: WIP

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) Connect programmers in a place where they can share and discuss code. Like stackoverflow as a social media site

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: Crete user accounts, connect with out users/add friends, crete/edit profiles, basic feed of connections

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific: Ruby, Rails, Postgresql, React

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific: Direct messages, post/interact with others posts eg comment/react, ability to share code snippets/images, ability to create groups and invite other users, connect other accounts like GH.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require? I believe all of this functionality can be accomplished with the use of ruby gems, but I will need to research how to connect account to a github account and what requirements that will need.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know? nope
